## Scope & Limitations

### Included ✓
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials only
- ClinicalTrials.gov API integration
- Basic outcome labeling from trial status
- Calibrated probability predictions
- Interactive filtering and detail views

### Excluded (Out of Scope)
- Phase 1 or Phase 4 trials
- PDF/NLP parsing of SEC filings
- Financial modeling or stock predictions
- Real-time update pipelines
- Authentication or user accounts
- Historical trial result validation

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Outcome Labels:** Heuristic-based rather than from actual trial results
   - Uses completion status and enrollment as proxies
   - Production system would parse actual primary endpoint results

2. **Feature Set:** Limited to basic trial metadata
   - No detailed protocol analysis
   - No investigator experience or prior success rates
   - No therapeutic area sophistication beyond indication name

3. **Model Simplicity:** Linear logistic regression
   - Good baseline but could be enhanced with ensemble methods
   - No time-series or longitudinal modeling

4. **Ticker Information:** Not integrated
   - Placeholder "N/A" in dashboard
   - Would require separate company/ticker mapping database
